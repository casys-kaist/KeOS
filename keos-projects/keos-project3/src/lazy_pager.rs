//! # Lazy Paging
//!
//! The lazy paging or demand paging is an another policy for the
//! paging, which used by modern operating systems. Unlike the [`EagerPager`]
//! that you implemented in project 2, the [`LazyPager`] defers physical page
//! allocation until a page fault occurs. This method optimizes memory usage by
//! mapping memory pages **on demand**, rather than preallocating them.
//!
//! Instead of allocating physical memory during the `mmap` call, the OS records
//! **metadata** about the mapping and waits to allocate physical memory until
//! the first **page fault** on that region. When a page fault occurs, the
//! kernel allocates and maps the required physical page.
//! In other words, **page table entries are created only when accessed**.
//!
//! ## Page Fault in KeOS
//!
//! The main function responsible for handling page faults lies in
//! [`Task::page_fault`]. This resolves the page fault reason into
//! [`PageFaultReason`] by reading the `cr2`, which contains faulting address,
//! and decoding the error code on the interrupt stack.
//!
//! It then delegates the page fault handling into the
//! [`LazyPager::handle_page_fault`]. This method is responsible to look up the
//! lazy mapping metadata recorded during the `mmap` and determine whether the
//! fault is bogus fault or not. If the address is valid, it should allocate a
//! new physical page and maps the page into page table. Otherwise, killing the
//! current process by returning the [`KernelError`].
//!
//! ## [`VmAreaStruct`]
//!
//! The [`VmAreaStruct`] represents a range of virtual addresses that share the
//! same memory permissions, similar to the Linux kernel's `struct
//! vm_area_struct`. It serves as the core metadata structure for memory-mapped
//! regions created via `mmap`, capturing the virtual range and the method
//! for populating that region's contents on access.
//!
//! Each [`VmAreaStruct`] is associated with an implementation of the
//! [`MmLoader`] trait, which defines how the contents of a page should be
//! supplied when the region is accessed. This trait-based abstraction
//! enables the kernel to support multiple types of memory mappings in a uniform
//! way. For instance, file-backed mappings use a [`FileBackedLoader`], which
//! reads contents from a file, while anonymous mappings use an [`AnonLoader`],
//! which typically supplies zero-filled pages. Each loader implementation can
//! maintain its own internal state, supporting extensibility and encapsulates
//! the complexity of mapping behavior within each loader.
//!
//! The [`MmLoader`] trait provides a single method, `load`, which is called
//! during demand paging when a page fault occurs at an address within the
//! associated [`VmAreaStruct`]. The method must return a fully initialized
//! [`Page`] object corresponding to that virtual address. The returned page is
//! then mapped into the page table by the pager.
//!
//! This loader-based architecture provides a clean separation of concerns:
//! [`VmAreaStruct`] tracks regions and permissions, while [`MmLoader`]
//! encapsulates how pages are provisioned. This allows KeOS to support flexible
//! and efficient memory models while maintaining clean abstractions.
//!
//! ## Implementation Requirements
//! You need to implement the followings:
//! - [`LazyPager`]
//! - [`LazyPager::new`]
//! - [`LazyPager::mmap`]
//! - [`LazyPager::munmap`]
//! - [`LazyPager::get_user_page`]
//! - [`LazyPager::access_ok`]
//! - [`PageFaultReason::is_demand_paging_fault`]
//! - [`LazyPager::do_lazy_load`]
//! - [`VmAreaStruct`]
//! - [`FileBackedLoader`]
//! - [`FileBackedLoader::load`]
//!
//! After implement the functionalities, move on to the next [`section`].
