//! # Mutex.
//!
//! Mutex is a synchronization primitive that allows **only one thread at a
//! time** to access a critical section of code, protecting shared resources
//! such as memory, files, or device state from concurrent modification.
//! Unlike the spin lock, it **blocks** threads trying to acquire it if another
//! thread already holds the lock.
//!
//! The [`Mutex`] maintains the list of threads sleeping on the mutex.
//! When unlocking, the kernel **wakes up** one of the waiting threads.
//! In KeOS, you can sleep the current thread by calling the
//! [`Current::park_with`]. This function takes a closure to run before falling
//! in sleep with a argument [`ParkHandle`], which is the handle to wake up the
//! sleeping thread.
//!
//! Although mutex and spin lock provides similar synchronization guarantees,
//! they are used in different circumstances. The following table compares the
//! spin lock and mutex.
//!
//! |                | SpinLock               | Mutex                    |
//! |----------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
//! | Waiting thread | Spins (busy-waits)       | Sleeps                   |
//! | CPU usage      | High (wastes CPU cycles) | Low (no busy waiting)     |
//! | Overhead       | Low (fast if uncontended)| Higher (due to sleep/wake)|
//!
//! These characterists lead that the spin lock is suitable when critical
//! sections are extremely short and contention is rare, because spinning wastes
//! CPU cycles. On the other side, the mutex is better for longer critical
//! sections or when a lock may be held for a non-trivial amount of time, as
//! sleeping threads do not waste CPU.
//!
//! ## Implementation Requirements
//! You need to implement the followings:
//! - [`Mutex`]
//! - [`Mutex::new`]
//! - [`Mutex::lock`]
//! - [`MutexGuard::unlock`]
//!
//! After implement the functionalities, move on to the next [`section`].

/// A mutual exclusion primitive useful for protecting shared data

/// This mutex will block threads waiting for the lock to become available.
/// The mutex can be created via a [`new`] constructor. Each spinlock has a
/// type parameter which represents the data that it is protecting. The data can
/// only be accessed through the guards returned from [`lock`] and
/// [`try_lock`], which guarantees that the data is only ever accessed when the
/// mutex is locked.

/// ```
/// use alloc::sync::Arc;
/// use keos::sync::Mutex;
/// use keos::thread;
///
/// const N: usize = 10;
///
/// // Spawn a few threads to increment a shared variable (non-atomically), and
/// // let the main thread know once all increments are done.
/// //
/// // Here we're using an Arc to share memory among threads, and the data inside

///         // which can access the shared state when the lock is held.
///         //
///         // We unwrap() the return value to assert that we are not expecting
