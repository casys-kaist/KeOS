//! # Multithreaded Process
//!
//! Modern applications increasingly rely on **multithreading** to achieve
//! responsiveness, scalability, and efficient utilization of multicore
//! processors. By enabling a single process to run multiple threads
//! concurrently, the system can perform I/O and computation in parallel, reduce
//! latency, and better respond to user interactions or real-time events.
//!
//! To support such workloads, the operating system must provide robust
//! mechanisms for creating, scheduling, and synchronizing threads within a
//! single process. This includes managing shared memory access, ensuring
//! thread-safe operations, and allowing coordination through synchronization
//! primitives such as mutexes, condition variables, and semaphores.
//!
//! In KeOS, extending the process abstraction to support multithreading is a
//! critical step toward building a realistic and capable system. This
//! enhances your knowledge about how the multithreading, the foundation for
//! concurrent programming models, works in real-world operating system.
//!
//! ## Multithreading in KeOS
//!
//! Previously, a process in KeOS consisted of a single thread. Your goal is
//! extending the process to run **multiple concurrent threads**, each with its
//! own execution context but sharing the same address space and resources.
//! Each thread maintains its own register states while sharing the same states.
//!
//! In earlier projects, each `Process` owned its own [`FileStruct`] and
//! [`MmStruct`]. However, on the multi-threaded model, these components are
//! **shared across all threads** of a process. That is, they become **shared
//! resources**, requiring proper synchronization. To support shared and mutable
//! access, these resources are wrapped inside an `Arc<Mutex<_>>`.
//! - [`Arc`] provides shared ownership with reference counting.
//! - [`Mutex`] ensures exclusive access to mutable state.
//!
//! This allows multiple threads to safely access and modify shared structures
//! like file tables and virtual memory mappings.
//!
//! #### Thread Life Cycle
//!
//! KeOS supports a lightweight threading model within a single process,
//! enabling multiple threads to execute concurrently while sharing the same
//! address space. The life cycle of a thread is managed through four key system
//! calls:
//!
//! - [`thread_create`]: Creates a new thread within the same process, executing
//!   a given function on a user-supplied stack.
//! - [`thread_join`]: Waits for a specified thread to terminate and retrieves
//!   its return value.
//! - [`exit`]: Terminates the calling thread without affecting other threads in
//!   the same process.
//! - [`exit_group`]: Terminates all threads within the process simultaneously.
//!
//! When creating a new thread via [`thread_create`], the user must provide a
//! pointer to a valid, writable memory region that will serve as the new
//! threadâ€™s stack. This approach mirrors Linux's `clone()` system call and
//! gives userspace full control over stack allocation and reuse. The kernel
//! validates that the provided stack lies within a properly mapped and writable
//! memory region to ensure memory safety.
//!
//! Threads can be terminated individually using the [`exit`] system call,
//! which affects only the calling thread. Other threads in the same process
//! continue executing. To coordinate with thread termination, a thread may
//! invoke [`thread_join`], which blocks until the target thread exits and
//! returns its result. This can be implemented using a [`Semaphore`]
//! initialized with zero permits, where the exiting thread signals completion
//! by releasing a permit.
//!
//! In contrast, [`exit_group`] is used when the entire process must be
//! terminated, bringing down all associated threads by calling
//! [`thread::kill_by_tid`]. This is necessary in scenarios such as a fatal
//! error in the main thread, unhandled signals, or explicit process termination
//! by the application. Unlike [`exit`], which only marks the calling thread for
//! termination, [`exit_group`] ensures that all threads in the process are
//! promptly and safely terminated, and that the process is cleaned up
//! consistently. This behavior aligns with the semantics of multi-threaded
//! processes in modern operating systems and prevents resource leaks or partial
//! process shutdowns.
//!
//! Together, these mechanisms provide a simple yet robust model for managing
//! thread life cycles in KeOS, balancing fine-grained control with process-wide
//! coordination.
//!
//! ## Implementation Requirements
//! You need to implement the followings:
//! - [`Thread`]
//! - [`Thread::from_file_mm_struct`]
//! - [`Thread::with_file_struct_mut`]
//! - [`Thread::with_mm_struct_mut`]
//! - [`Thread::thread_create`]
//! - [`Thread::exit`]
//! - [`Thread::thread_join`]
//! - [`Thread::exit_group`]
//!
//! By implementing this section, you can move on to the next [`section`] with
//! the final form of execution model that widely used in modern OSes:
//! ```text
//! +========= Process =========+
//! | Shared States:            |
//! |  - MmStruct               |
//! |  - FileStruct             |
//! |                           |
//! | Threads:                  |
//! |  +----- Thread 1 -----+   |
