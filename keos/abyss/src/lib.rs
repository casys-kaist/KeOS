//! The abyss of kernel that operates hardwares.
//!
//! This crate contains collections of hardware communications.
//!
//! You might see the codes of this code for your personal study for how x86_64
//! architecture cooperates with operating systems,
//! HOWEVER, most of codes in this crate exceeds the scope of the CS330
//! curriculum, which is why this crate is named "abyss".
//!
//! In other words, you do **NOT** have to see codes in this crate. Neither in
//! exams or projects, this crate is definitely **NOT** a coverage. Nonetheless,
//! if you want to go deeper into the low-level of the operating system, you may
//! see the internal of this crate with the [`OSDev Wiki`].
//!
//! **IN PARTICULAR, YOU ARE *NOT* SUPPOSED TO DIRECTLY USE THE MODULES OF
//! THIS CRATE TO IMPLEMENT THE KEOS PROJECT.**
//! We are not responsible for any problems occured by (mis)using codes of this
//! crate directly.
//!
//! Instead, you are supposed to see [`keos`] crate to see which modules (or
//! functions) are available for implementing KeOS Project.
